# High-Stakes Hangman

play it at: https://jennakohls.github.io/hangman2/

Traditional hangman, particularly when played digitally, often devolves from a
game about testing one's linguistic guessing abilities to a matter of luck and
rote clicking. With no stakes, the easiest and most common way to play hangman
online, with only one player, is simply clicking common letters until the word
becomes obvious. The game is, then, no longer about attempting to figure out
a clue or use logical reasoning to determine likely letters, but having good luck
when picking random letters.

High-Stakes Hangman seeks to remedy this frustration by bringing an incentive
for critical thinking back into the game. Players can toggle on and off between
the standard 'Guess Mode' and the 'Answer Mode'. In the latter, correct letter
selections grant lives back to the player, but one wrong move and the game ends instantly.

This changes the flow of the game significantly. In the beginning, a player can
select common letters, but if they figure out the answer early on, can simply input it and move on.
They also get the increased intellectual satisfaction of being right for higher stakes.
More interestingly, however, is if a player is not sure of the answer and does not have
enough lives to keep guessing randomly, they may bet on their confidence and attempt
to win lives back.
